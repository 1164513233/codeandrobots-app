## Where to Start

If you're a developer looking to contribute, check out the [help wanted](https://github.com/codeandrobots/codeandrobots-app/labels/help%20wanted) label encompassing issues which need some love or [drop us an email](mailto:codeandrobotshq@gmail.com?subject=Hi&body=I%20would%20like%20to%20help) and we'll help you get started.

If you've got an idea for a new feature, please email us your suggestions at [codeandrobotshq@gmail.com](mailto:codeandrobotshq@gmail.com?subject=Idea), as adding new features requires generating consensus first.

### Branching Guide

`master` on the main repository always contains the latest changes. This means that it is WIP for the next minor version and should NOT be considered stable. Stable versions are tagged using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

On your local repository, you should always work on a branch to make keeping up-to-date and submitting pull requests easier, but in most cases you should submit your pull requests to `master`. Where necessary, for example if multiple people are contributing on a large feature, we make use of feature branches.

#### Branch structure

- **master** Every stable feature or fix goes to `master`
- **feature/id-xxx** You're working on an issue and this is your feature branch, see this [example feature/1-hide-beta-feature-ios branch](https://github.com/codeandrobots/codeandrobots-app/tree/feature/1-hide-beta-feature-ios)
- **fix/id-xxx** Fixing an issue, e.g. `fix/2-ble-discovery`
- **test/id-xxx** This is an unstable / experimental branch, e.g. `test/3-wifi-support`
- **refactor/id-xxx** For refactoring purposes, e.g. `refactor\4-bluetooth-service-refactor`

### Commit Messages

We have a handful of simple standards for commit messages which help us to generate readable changelogs. Please follow this wherever possible and mention the associated issue number.

- **1st line:** Max 80 character summary written in past tense
- **2nd line:** [Always blank]
- **3rd line:** `refs #000` or `closes #000` or `no issue`
- **4th line:** Whatever you want. Any extra details can be included from here

Good commit message examples: [one](https://github.com/codeandrobots/codeandrobots-app/commit/9f26ac76a1dc53b1119718a987fee0ee51d3ae7f), [two](https://github.com/codeandrobots/codeandrobots-app/commit/0f795fa2831eef286364215403d6264efe702859) and [three](https://github.com/codeandrobots/codeandrobots-app/commit/e63bc34dfce4e3e3818bdd2b4cc38931c91bffb4).

### Submitting Pull Requests

We aim to merge any straightforward, well-understood bug fixes or improvements immediately, as long as they pass our tests (run `yarn test` to check locally). We generally donâ€™t merge new features and larger changes without prior discussion with the core product team for tech/design specification.

Please provide plenty of context and reasoning around your changes, to help us merge quickly. Closing an already open issue is our preferred workflow. If your PR gets out of date, we may ask you to rebase as you are more familiar with your changes than we will be.
